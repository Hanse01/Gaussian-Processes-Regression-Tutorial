# Offroad Robotics Report LaTeX Template

This template provides a basic LaTeX class file [offroad-report.cls](https://code.engineering.queensu.ca/offroad/offroad_report_template/blob/master/offroad-report.cls) and an example file [offroad-example.tex](https://code.engineering.queensu.ca/offroad/offroad_report_template/blob/master/offroad-example.tex). The purpose here is to serve as a starting point for Offroad-related reports and to maintain a standard look and feel across reports generated by different people within our group. You may choose to modify this template for your specific report, but please try to keep the same basic style. Most edits should not require you to edit the class file.

## Report Numbering

You may choose to give your report a number. All report numbers from our group should have the general format **Offroad-Project-###**. For example, if you are working on a technical note for ESA, you might call your reports Offroad-ESA-TN1, Offroad-ESA-TN2, etc. You might also consider including the document number in your title; for example, as
**Offroad-Project-###: The Document Title**.
